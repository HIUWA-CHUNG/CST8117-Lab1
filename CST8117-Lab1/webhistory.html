    <div style="color:red"><h2>Web1.0</h2></div>
 <p>Web 1.0 was the first stage of the World Wide Web revolution, usually referred to as read-only web. This was how the Internet we know today started in the first place, 
    <br>where the websites were merely informational and comprised entirely static content; they were only linked together by hyperlinks and lacked any interactive content or design elements. 
    <br>This was the era when only text emails could be written and sent, one could not even upload or attach any images or pictures. 
    <br>Although, personal pages were quite common, consisting mainly of static pages hosted on ISP-run web servers, or on free web hosting services.
    <br>In a nutshell, Web 1.0 was a content delivery network (CDN) that enabled to showcase of the piece of information on the websites where users passively receive information without being given the opportunity to post reviews, comments, and feedback. 
    <br>The content here was served from the server's file system and the pages were built using Server Side Includes (SSI) or Common Gateway Interface(CGI).</p>

<p>Web 2.0 was the second stage of the evolution of the web, also called the read-write web and it was the phase when websites grew in terms of user interaction. 
    <br>It was the period when websites became more focused on user-generated content, usability, and interoperability for end-users, leading them to become the - participative social web.
    During Web 2.0, terms like blogs, social media, and video streaming gained popularity. This time period is also acknowledged for the ease with which music and video clips could be exchanged. 
    <br>It opened doors to podcasting, blogging, tagging, curating with RSS, social bookmarking, social networking, social media, web content voting, etc. 
    <br>It was the birthplace of Youtube, Wiki, Flickr, Facebook, and so on. 
    <br>Also, blogging became popular with the introduction of WordPress which started as a PHP & MySQL-led blogging platform and has now advanced to become a full content managed system (CMS) which powers over a quarter of the web and e-Commerce completely revolutionized the way we shop.</p>

    <div style="color:rgb(162, 163, 53)"><h2>Web3.0</h2></div>
<p>Web 3.0 is the next generation of web, also termed as the executable web or read- write-execute web. It began with the onset of dynamic applications, interactive services, and “machine-to-machine” interaction. 
    <br>It is used to describe many evolutions of web usage and interaction between various paths. Data is not owned in this case, but rather shared, with services displaying different views for the same web/data.
    It has also been referred to as Semantic Web to describe a web in which machines would process content in a humanlike way where all data would be connected and understood both contextually and conceptually, leading to the herald of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 
    <br>With this, information is more connected thanks to semantic metadata. As a result, the user experience evolves to another level of connectivity that leverages all the available information.
    <br>Two key terms associated with this phase are - semantic markup and web services. Apart from defining an item's appearance, semantic markup aids in its description. 
    <br>It guides in the search for other matched items based on similar attributes. Semantics, as opposed to Web 2.0, focuses on easy searching. You can now simply enter a keyword into Google Search and it will intelligently suggest related words.</p>
